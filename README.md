# WILD 562 Lab5 : Multiple Logisitic Regression & Model Selection

In Lab 5, we extend the analysis of habitat use by wolves in two wolf packs from 2001-2005 in Banff National Park to multivariate analysis of habitat selection using  multiple logistic regression to estimate a resource selection function (RSF) as a function of the availability of resources.
