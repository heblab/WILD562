# Lab 7: Mixed-effects RSF Models

Recent advances in the study of resource selection have overcome limitations of inflexible study designs, autocorrelation, and the multi-scale nature of habitat selection.  Resource selection functions (RSFs) estimated by logistic regression are increasingly used in wildlife studies to identify critical resources for animal populations and to predict species occurrence.  When using telemetry data for RSF models, individuals are monitored and often pooled to estimate population-level RSFs without regard to group-(strata, spatial, etc.) or individual-level variation.  Pooling assumes both observations and their errors are independent and, resource selection is constant given individual variation in resource availability.  Researchers have identified ways to minimize autocorrelation, but variation between individuals, especially that caused by differences in availability (i.e., functional responses in resource selection) - have not been well addressed.  Here we review random effects models and their application to RSF models to overcome these common limitations of resource selection studies.

This lab introduces the concepts of the addition of random effects for group-level hierarchical structure in resource selection, and the concept that group-level selection for a particular resource may be variable.

```

## 1.1 Rescaling variables
The error messages from the fit of the wolf data with a random effect for pack tells us that we need to rescale our variables.  What is rescaling? In R, the command 
```
scale(x) 
```
standardizes the data with respect to the mean and standard deviation of x. Note the defaults are to center to 0 and scale by dividing the centered x values by their standard deviation. The new variable has a mean = 0 and are now expressed in units +/- of standard deviations. This is a very common/important step in the fitting of GLMM's. This also has the direct advantage of being able to now directly compare the coefficients of continuous covariates in terms of SDs. Finally, not we do not really ever scale categorical variables.  These coefficients are already expressed in a way that can be compared to each other. 

```{r}
head(wolfkde3)
wolfkde3$Elevation2_sc <-scale(wolfkde3$Elevation2)
hist(wolfkde3$Elevation2)
hist(wolfkde3$Elevation2_sc)
plot(wolfkde3$Elevation2, wolfkde3$Elevation2_sc)
summary(wolfkde3$Elevation2)
summary(wolfkde3$Elevation2_sc)

wolfkde3$DistFromHighHumanAccess2_sc <- scale(wolfkde3$DistFromHighHumanAccess2)
plot(wolfkde3$DistFromHighHumanAccess2_sc, wolfkde3$DistFromHighHumanAccess2)

```

## Refitting Top Model with Standardized Continuous Data
```{r}
top.env2 <- glm(used ~ Elevation2_sc + DistFromHighHumanAccess2_sc + openConif+modConif+closedConif+mixed+herb+shrub+water+burn, family=binomial(logit), data=wolfkde3)
summary(top.env2)
```

Now you can directly compare the coefficients of Elevation and Distance from high human access? Which one has a 'stronger' effect?  Comparing the categorical landcover coefficients, which one is the strongest ? (burn) 
How now do we fit with one model?

```{r} 
top.env.mixed2 <- glmer(used~Elevation2_sc + DistFromHighHumanAccess2_sc + openConif+modConif+closedConif+mixed+herb+shrub+water+burn+(1|pack), data=wolfkde3,family=binomial(link="logit"))
summary(top.env.mixed2)
```
See! - nasty error messages are gone. 


## 1.2 Interpreting Random Effects

Now we can also discuss how to interpret the random effects terms. We are now given a variance and standard deviation for the Random effect (here, pack). This is reported in units of standard deviations, which is another nice reason to standardize continuous (and categorical) covariates.  Here, we can interpre that there is a substantially STRONGER response by wolves to elevation than individual level variability. i.e., Beta-elevation = -3.1523, and St.Dev wolf = 0.5472, or about 5.7 times stronger response to elevation than individual wolf pack variation. 

Contrast that with the comparison of St.Dev (pack) to the coefficient for Distance from High Human Access = 0.4316.  This tells us that while most wolf packs avoided high human activity, there was more variation between packs in this response than the response. This tells us something about the variability in pack-level responses to human activity. 

Which is best from an AIC perspective?

```{r}
AIC(top.env2, top.env.mixed2, top.env.rd, top.env.bv)
```
Warning message:
In AIC.default(top.env, top.env.mixed, top.env.rd, top.env.bv) :
models are not all fitted to the same number of observations

Note that we get this error message because top.env.rd and top.env.bv are fit with only subsets of the data. However, recall that for 1 dataset, AIC and LL is additive. Thus, the 'additive' AIC of the two 'separate' models is 396.4251 + 851.1538 = 1247.58 which is substantively better than the mixed effect model.

Either way, comparing the fixed-effect versus the mixed-effect model, we can see that the glmm is far better. However, a simpler model with two separate models, one for each wolf pack, explained the datset better. But in practice, we would almost never fit a model with just 2 levels of a random effect, so now we will go to a more 'sensible' dataset. 


# Mixed-effects Models with Migrant Elk

Yeah! we will analyze some data besides the now very tired wolf data. We will use elk GPS collar data from migratory elk in our long-term Ya Ha Tinda elk study system. These data are based on: Hebblewhite, M., and E. H. Merrill. 2009. Trade-offs between predation risk and forage differ between migrant strategies in a migratory ungulate. Ecology 90:3445-3454.

![Figure 7.2. Radiocollared elk (credit: Celie Intering)](/Users/mark.hebblewhite/Box Sync/Teaching/UofMcourses/WILD562/Spring2019/Labs/lab7/elk.jpg)

For background, trade-offs between predation risk and forage fundamentally drive resource
selection by animals. Among migratory ungulates, trade-offs can occur at large spatial scales
through migration, which allows an ‘‘escape’’ from predation, but trade-offs can also occur at
finer spatial scales. Previous authors suggest that ungulates will avoid predation risk at the
largest scale, although few studies have examined multi-scale trade-offs to test for the relative
benefits of risk avoidance across scales. Building on previously developed spatial models of
forage and wolf predation risk, we tested for trade-offs at the broad landscape scale and at a
finer, within-home-range scale for migratory and non-migratory resident elk (Cervus elaphus)
during summer in the Canadian Rockies in Banff National Park (BNP) and adjacent Alberta,
Canada.

## 2.1 Exploring and managing data
```{r}
# Bring in data
elk <- read.table("lab7_elk_migrant.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings="NA", dec=".", strip.white=TRUE)
head(elk)
elk$elkuidF <- as.factor(elk$elkuid)

# get to know our data
table(elk$elkuid, elk$year)
table(elk$elkuid, elk$used)

#### Get to know our data graphically
ggplot(elk, aes(x=utmx, y = utmy, color = elkuidF)) + geom_point()

## how about 'just' the telemetry locations?
elk.used <- subset(elk, elk$used == 1)
ggplot(elk.used, aes(x=utmx, y = utmy, color = elkuidF)) + geom_point()
write.csv(elk.used, "lab8_elk_migrant_used.csv")  ## we might want to use this later, like in Lab 8
```
What kind of sampling design and scale is this?

So there are some data from 2003, most from 2004, 1 elk from 2002.  And there is wide variation in the number of used and available locations for each elk from 52 (elk 90 0's) to 3711 (elk 29 0's). Any guess why there is variation in the number of 0's?  Home range size: # of locations was based on an areal basis.

Today, we are going to be conducting an RSF as a function of Forage Biomass (totalherb) and wolf predation risk (ctotrisk).  Lets look at these two variables and get to know them. 
```{r}
hist(elk$ctotrisk)
hist(log(elk$ctotrisk))

summary(elk[,30:31]) ## So 1579 NA's predation risk values, and 11 NA's for total herbaceous vegetation
length(elk$ctotrisk)
```

So we need to subset dataset for complete.cases where there are no NA data - why is this important?  How can we compare models using AIC with different number of rows?
```{r}
elk2 <- elk[complete.cases(elk[30:31]), ]
summary(elk2)
length(elk2$ctotrisk)
## Still need to clean up predation risk data being predicted > 1
elk2$ctotrisk[elk2$ctotrisk>1]=1

table(elk2$elkuid, elk2$year)
table(elk2$elkuid, elk2$used)

# Compute sample size for each elk
n = tapply(elk$idn, elk$elkuid,length)
n

# Calculate mean wolf predation risk
wolf = tapply(na.omit(elk2$ctotrisk), elk2$elkuid[which((elk2$ctotrisk!="NA")==TRUE)],mean)
wolf
hist(wolf)
### this shows a wide variation in the exposure of elk to wolf predation risk

forage = tapply(na.omit(elk2$totalherb), elk$elkuid[which((elk2$totalherb!="NA")==TRUE)],mean)
forage
hist(forage)
```

## 2.1 Scaling risk and forage
```{r}
str(elk2)
elk2$totalherb_sc <- scale(elk2$totalherb)
elk2$ctotrisk_sc <- scale(elk2$ctotrisk)
elk2$ctotrisk2_sc <- scale(elk2$ctotrisk2)
elk2$riskforage_sc <- scale(elk2$riskforage)
elk2$for2_sc <- scale(elk2$for2)
elk2$risk2_sc <- scale(elk2$risk2)

##### AGain, just to double check what scale is doing

plot(elk2$ctotrisk_sc, elk2$ctotrisk)
```

## Fitting Standard Fixed-Effects Model and Understanding Ecology

First, we are going to explore the straight forward RSF using the model from the Hebblewhite & Merrill (2008) paper discussed in class where migrant elk make trade-offs between risk and forage at the home range scale, as well as their interaction between risk and forage. We are not going to concern ourselves with model selection questions in this lab, but instead consider elk resource selection to be a function of wolf predation risk, total herbaceous forage biomass (g/m2) and their interaction.  
```{r}
# Fitting best model(s)
forage = glm(used~totalherb, data=elk2,family=binomial(link="logit"))
risk = glm(used~ctotrisk, data=elk2,family=binomial(link="logit"))
forANDrisk = glm(used~totalherb+ctotrisk, data=elk2,family=binomial(link="logit"))
forrisk = glm(used~totalherb+ctotrisk+ctotrisk*totalherb, data=elk2,family=binomial(link="logit"))

AIC(forage, risk, forANDrisk, forrisk)

## Best model from AIC perspective is forrisk

summary(forrisk)

## Refit top model with scaled
forrisk_sc = glm(used~totalherb_sc+ctotrisk_sc+ctotrisk_sc*totalherb_sc, data=elk2,family=binomial(link="logit"))
summary(forrisk_sc)
```

## Visualizing the Interaction from the Unstandardized Fixed-effects model
```{r}
# Calculate some summary statistics for forage
hist(elk$totalherb)
hist(log(elk$totalherb))
quantile(elk$totalherb,na.rm=TRUE)
mean(elk$totalherb,na.rm=TRUE)

herb.lo = 5
herb.med = 15
herb.hi = 50

# Make predictions
predrisk = seq(0,1,0.01)
pred.lo = predict(forrisk,type="response", newdata = data.frame(totalherb=herb.lo, ctotrisk=predrisk))
pred.med = predict(forrisk,type="response", newdata = data.frame(totalherb=herb.med, ctotrisk=predrisk))
pred.hi = predict(forrisk,type="response", newdata = data.frame(totalherb=herb.hi, ctotrisk=predrisk))

# Make plot
plot(elk2$ctotrisk,elk2$used, xlab="Risk", ylab="Pr(Use)")
lines(predrisk,pred.lo, lty=1)
lines(predrisk,pred.med, lty=2)
lines(predrisk,pred.hi, lty=3)
legend(x=0.7,y=0.95, legend=c("Observed","Low Forage","Medium Forage","High Forage"), pch=c(1,rep(-1,3)),lty=c(-1,1:3),bty="n")
```

## Visualizing the interactions with ggplot2
```{r}
elk2$usedF <- as.factor(elk2$used)
ggplot(elk2, aes(x=ctotrisk, y = used)) + stat_smooth(method="glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"))
ggplot(elk2, aes(x=totalherb, y = used)) + stat_smooth(method="glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"))
ggplot(elk2, aes(x=riskforage, y = used)) + geom_rug() + stat_smooth(method="glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"))
```
But what does this last plot mean? Need to make a categorical variable at 3 different levels of forage

Note I use the Hmisc package here to split into categories
```{r}
elk2$forage.cat  <- as.factor(as.numeric(cut2(elk2$totalherb, g=3)))
elk2$forage.cat  <- cut2(elk2$totalherb, g=3)
ggplot(elk2, aes(x=ctotrisk, y = used, fill = forage.cat)) + stat_smooth(method="glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"))

elk2$risk.cat  <- cut2(elk2$ctotrisk, g=3)
ggplot(elk2, aes(x=totalherb, y = used, fill = risk.cat)) + stat_smooth(method="glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"))
```
Both graphs show that the effect of the interaction is only really present at low forage levels when elk select for high predation risk, but otherwise they select high forage biomass at all times, just less when under high predation risk.  


## Visualizing the Marginal Effects with Resource Selection mep
This is from the Resource Selection package by Subhash Lele, and is a nice plot.  However, it does not do interactive effects. 
```{r}
mep(forrisk_sc)
```

# Robust Standard Errors with Clustering 

This is a demonstration of the Newey-West Sandwhich Estimator - i.e., clustering the standard errors taking into account autocorrelation within an individual elk, Heterskedasticity.  All clustering does is account for the pseudoreplication within sample units, handy yes. 

The relevant paper demonstrating it with RSF models is: Nielsen, S. E., M. S. Boyce, G. B. Stenhouse, and R. H. Munro. 2002. Modeling grizzly bear habitats in the Yellowhead ecosystem of Alberta: taking autocorrelation seriously. Ursus 13:45-56.

This next command vcovHC generates the default heteroskedastic robust standard errors in R using the cvocHC() function in the sandwhich based package. 
```{r}
forrisk2 <-vcovHC(forrisk, elk$elkuid, type = "const", sandwhich = TRUE)
forrisk2

coeftest(forrisk, forrisk2)
```
Compare the SE's that are robust and not robust for comparison but without a cluster variable.  This reports a z-test statistic and associated P-value for whether there is a difference in the estimate of the two coefficients from the two models. This is a handy function in general to test the coefficients from 2 models of any type with the same structure. Here it tells us that there is a difference in the intercept (not really that ecologically interesting) and a difference in forage between the two models.  Because the Z-statistic is positive, 0.04 for totalherb, that tells us that failing to take into account the 'clustering' within individuals leads us to overesimate the effect of forage. 

# Fixed-effects Models with a Fixed-Effect for Each Individual Elk

Now we will fit a fixed-effects model with a fixed effect intercept for each individual elk, i.e., with 1 intercept per elk. Note we will use elkuidF as the factor here. 

```{r}
forriskFI = glm(used~totalherb+ctotrisk+ctotrisk*totalherb+elkuidF, data=elk,family=binomial(link="logit"))
summary(forriskFI)
```

Discussion - what does each coefficient mean in a used-available design? What is the correspondance between the sampling ratio of used to available locations and the coefficient?
```{r}
table(elk2$elkuid, elk2$used)
```
Check for elk 196, 141/(141+1120) = 0.557; B is 0.502 - close enough in multiple logit model with continuous covariates. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with using a fixed factor for individual or groups instead of random effects. Manly chapter 5 covers this.  However, why would we not just want to use this fixed effect? There are 2 reasons. First, philosophical - having to do with wanting to make inferences beyond just our collared sample. And second, the penalty of estimating all these additional coefficients for each individual elk. See here: 

```{r}
AIC(forriskFI, forage, risk, forANDrisk, forrisk)
```
 The main issue is the greater number of parameters, here, 1 for each individual elk. But, from an AIC perspective, the fixed-effects of each individual elk provide a better 'fit'. But again, remember what the intercept means in a used-available design.

# Two-Stage Modeling

Next we will explore the 'poor-mans' version of mixed-effects models, somewhere between fitting a fixed-effect for each individual elk and a full mixed-effect model.

The best papers to read here are: 
Fieberg, J., J. Matthiopoulos, M. Hebblewhite, M. S. Boyce, and J. L. Frair. 2010. Correlation and studies of habitat selection: problem, red herring or opportunity? Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 365:2233-2244., 

and 

Murtaugh, P. A. 2007. Simplicity and complexity in ecological data analysis. Ecology 88:56-62. and

Sawyer, H., R. M. Nielson, F. Lindzey, and L. L. Mcdonald. 2006. Winter Habitat Selection of Mule Deer Before and During Development of a Natural Gas Field. Journal of Wildlife Management 70:396-403, and 

## Fixed Effects Model for Each Individual
The first step I take is to fit one individual model to each individual elk or sampling unit. 
```{r}
elkids = sort(unique(elk2$elkuid))
modelnames = paste("elk",elkids)
models = list()

for (i in 1:length(elkids)){
	models[[i]]=glm(used~totalherb_sc+ctotrisk_sc+ctotrisk_sc*totalherb_sc, data=elk2,subset = elkuid==elkids[i], family=binomial(link="logit"))

}

names(models)=modelnames
#lapply(models,summary) #### Note I supressed this because it just spits out 17 models, 1 for each elk

# This creates a dataframe with the beta coefficients for each model/elk
coefs = as.data.frame(lapply(models, coef))
coefs

#Calculate means for each of the coefficients
mean(as.numeric(coefs[1,]))
mean(as.numeric(coefs[2,]))
mean(as.numeric(coefs[3,]))
mean(as.numeric(coefs[4,]))
```

Therefore, the linear part of the two-staged model would be:

Y =  -2.15 - 1.417xtotalherb_sc -6.006xctotrisk_sc + 6.657*totalherb_sc:ctotrisk_sc

Next, let us make some graphical displays of the Beta coefficients across individuals

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(as.numeric(coefs[1,]), main="intercept",breaks=10)
hist(as.numeric(coefs[2,]), main="Forage",breaks=10)
hist(as.numeric(coefs[3,]), main ="Risk",breaks=10)
hist(as.numeric(coefs[4,]), main="Forage*Risk",breaks=10)
```
So a biological conclusions is that there is substantial variation between individuals in their coefficients for forage, wolf predation risk and the interaction. 

# Mixed-Effects Models!

## 6.1 Mixed-effects model with random intercept

Review gain in class what a random intercept means in the context of a Used-Available Design. LEts start by fitting the model with a random intercept for each individual elk.  The key paper here is:

Gillies, C., M. Hebblewhite, S. E. Nielsen, M. Krawchuk, C. Aldridge, J. Frair, C. Stevens, D. J. Saher, and C. Jerde. 2006. Application of random effects to the study of resource selection by animals. Journal of Animal Ecology 75:887-898.


```{r}
fr.ri = glmer(used~totalherb_sc+ctotrisk_sc+ctotrisk_sc*totalherb_sc+(1|elkuid), data=elk2,family=binomial(link="logit"), verbose=FALSE)
summary(fr.ri)
```
Lets review how to interpret the Random Effects. Here, they are saying we have 17 elk with 34390 rows of data, and the Std. Dev = 0.7899, which, compared to our standardized coefficient estimates for total herb and wolf risk are relatively huge. That is, another way of saying there is substantial individual-level variation in resource selection between individuals, equal to or greater than the variation in the actual strength of selection.  This is an important insight, and something we already learned from our Two-stage modeling above. 


# Learning about How GLMM's are Being Fit

By default, R is fitting the GLMM by Laplace approximation to the MLE estimator, which by default is 1 decimal place/point (numerical integration points) at which the model is fit with Adaptive Gauss-Hermite Quadrature.  The recommended # of nip points is >> 5 for most binomial GLMM's. We set this by changing the nACQ - integer scalar's. 

nAGQ- integer scalar - the number of points per axis for evaluating the adaptive Gauss-Hermite approximation to the log-likelihood. Defaults to 1, corresponding to the Laplace approximation. Values greater than 1 produce greater accuracy in the evaluation of the log-likelihood at the expense of speed. A value of zero uses a faster but less exact form of parameter estimation for GLMMs by optimizing the random effects and the fixed-effects coefficients in the penalized iteratively reweighted least squares step. The key paper is:

Rabe-Hesketh, S., A. Skrondal, and A. Pickles. 2005. Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Limited and Discrete Dependent Variable Models With Nested Random Effects. Journal of Econometrics 128:301-323.

```{r}
fr.ri2 = glmer(used~totalherb_sc+ctotrisk_sc+ctotrisk_sc*totalherb_sc+(1|elkuid), data=elk2,family=binomial(link="logit"), verbose=FALSE, nAGQ = 10)
summary(fr.ri2)
```
Note there really is no major effect in this dataset.  But - good to know.  Also note that it takes a lot longer to fit the model. 

## Comparing Random Intercept Model and Two-Stage Model Coefficients
```{r}
# Useful functions
fixef(fr.ri) # This is the fixed effects coefficients
ranef(fr.ri) # These are the random effects, which in this model is just (1|elkuid), so, one coefficient for each individual elk
```
Compare these to the fixed effect coefficients estimated with an intercept for each individual elk? How do they compare?

```{r}
coef(fr.ri) ### Note this shows you the entire coefficient matrix for all individual elk - note that the rest of the model is fixed for each individual elk. 
```

Next we will compare the intercepts from two step and mixed-effects model.  This forces us to think about what the interpretation of a random intercept is in a used-available design. 
First, I out everything in one place; I add the fixed intercept to the random effects here.Note you could also get this from coef(fr.ri)
```{r}
B0 <- cbind(as.numeric(coefs[1,]),ranef(fr.ri)$elkuid[,1]+fixef(fr.ri)[1])
rownames(B0)=rownames(ranef(fr.ri)$elkuid)
colnames(B0) = c("Two-Step","Random Effects")
str(B0)
B0
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(B0[,1], B0[, 2])
abline(lm(B0[,1] ~ B0[, 2]))
```
This plot shows the Two-step coefficients for each individual elk on the X axix, and the random coefficient for each individual elk from the GLMM on the Y-axis. What do you notice? What are the axes of Y and X here?  Should there be a relationship between these two?
```{r}
# Make a histogram
multhist(list(B0[,1],B0[,2]), xlab = "Intercept Coefficient",ylab="Frequency (# Elk)", col = c("gray","tan"))
legend("topright", legend = colnames(B0), fill = c("gray","tan"), bty = "n")

```
This histogram shows us that the mixed-effects model is estimating the distribution of random intercepts here as 'more' gaussian/normally distributed than the Two-stage data. 

## Random Coefficients - Mixed Effects Model with Random Coefficient

Based on our previous two-step models above, we can see there is a lot more variation in the response of elk to total predation risk.  So, here we will fit random coefficients for the first time to wolf predation risk. 

```{r}
fr.rc = glmer(used~totalherb_sc+ctotrisk_sc+totalherb_sc*ctotrisk_sc+(ctotrisk_sc|elkuid), data=elk2,family=binomial(link="logit"), verbose=FALSE)

fixef(fr.rc) # This is the fixed effects coefficients
ranef(fr.rc) # These are the random effects, which in this model is just (1|elkuid), so, one coefficient for each individual elk
```
First, note that fitting random coefficients took a long time with this modest dataset. Compare these to the fixed effect coefficients estimated with an intercept for each individual elk? How do they compare?
```{r}
coef(fr.rc)
##### Note here that the coefficient for predation risk is allowed to vary
summary(fr.rc)
```

Again, look at the Std.Dev of the random effects for elkuid (intercept) and wolfpredation risk, 8.533. That is DOUBLE the strength of the coefficient for wolf predation risk in the model. Also note that the coefficient for wolf predation risk has dramatically changed, becoming much stronger now. 

NExt, we now see the correlation between the two random effects here, which is 0.97.  This means that there is a positive covariance between animals with a high value for a random intercept, and animals with a larger coefficient (more positive) for wolf predation risk. Interpreting this is tricky.  Think of what a positive intercept means in a used-available design - this means that they have more 1's than 0's, so, a smaller home range the way that we sampled availability based on areal extent. Why would animals with small home ranges be 'selecting' areas of higher predation risk compared to animals with larger home ranges? This is a real ecologically interesting question to ponder with this dataset. 

We also see below the output the Correlation of Fixed Effects: This is a bit tricky to interpret. The "correlation of fixed effects" output doesn't have the intuitive meaning that most would ascribe to it. Specifically, is not about the correlation of the variables (as OP notes). It is in fact about the expected correlation of the regression coefficients. Although this may speak to multicollinearity it does not necessarily. In this case it is telling you that if you did the experiment again and it so happened that the coefficient for forage got smaller, it would not be correlated with the coefficient for wolf predation risk. In fact, in these Correlations of fixed effects, there is nothing too alarming here; the fact that wolf predation risk and the intercept values were positively correlated was already noted above with the random effects, and discussed above. But, if these fixed-effect coefficients were highly correlated, and the real coefficients, not just the intercepts, that would be more problematic and might suggest problems with confounding or collinearity. 

## Compare Parameters between Two-stage and Mixed-Models
```{r}
# Note that I use the coef function here
B0.rc = cbind(as.numeric(coefs[1,]),coef(fr.rc)$elkuid[,1])
rownames(B0.rc)=rownames(ranef(fr.ri)$elkuid)
colnames(B0.rc) = c("Two-Step","Random Effects")
B.risk = cbind(as.numeric(coefs[3,]),coef(fr.rc)$elkuid[,3])
rownames(B.risk)=rownames(ranef(fr.ri)$elkuid)
colnames(B.risk) = c("Two-Step","Random Effects")

## lets look at the Intercepts
B0.rc

## Next, lets look at the risk coefficients

B.risk
##### So, quite correlated from the 2 different models
plot(B.risk[,1], B.risk[,2])
abline(lm(B.risk[,1] ~ B.risk[, 2]))
```
So here there is some correlation between the coefficients for predation risk from the Two-stage models (X-axis) and the glmm (Y axis)

Lets look at histograms of the Beta coefficients. 
```{r}
# Make histogram of betas
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
multhist(list(B0.rc[,1],B0.rc[,2]), xlab = "Intercept Coefficient",ylab="Frequency (# Elk)", col = c("gray","tan"), ylim=c(0,10))
legend(2.4,10, legend = colnames(B0), fill = c("gray","tan"), bty = "n")
multhist(list(B.risk[,1],B.risk[,2]), xlab = "Risk Coefficient",ylab="Frequency (# Elk)", col = c("gray","tan"),ylim = c(0,10))
legend(2.4,10, legend = colnames(B0), fill = c("gray","tan"), bty = "n")
```
What is the assumption about the distribution of the random effects doing to the modeled responses here?

# Model Selection with Random Effects
```{r}
AIC(forriskFI, forage, risk, forANDrisk, forrisk, fr.ri, fr.rc)
```
So hands down, the top model here is a random effect of wolf predation risk, beating even the fixed-effect of each individual elk as an intercept (forriskFI). Note that model selection with random effects models gets a lot more complicated... here we are doing model selection on the Fixed effects only. 


# Predictions from GLMM RSF models. 

Obtaining predictions from GLMM Models is tricky. What are you trying to predict is the challening question? Marginal or population-averaged responses? Conditional or subjet specific responses?  

Moreover, a challenge remains in how best to actually use the models with random effects in it to make predictions, so there are a number of packages and discussions that essentially recommend bootrapping or simulation approaches. All of this ends up taking us to a Bayesian framework eventually..

## Plotting Predictions from Random Coefficient models
We will make predictions here using the fixed-effect coefficients (i.e., a marginal level prediction)
```{r}
##### First lets refit the top model with out scaled coefficients - note this takes a LOT longer. 
## Also - why am I doing this? To predict in the real scale! 

fr.rc2 = glmer(used~totalherb+ctotrisk+totalherb*ctotrisk+(ctotrisk|elkuid), data=elk2,family=binomial(link="logit"), verbose=FALSE)

# Plotting predictions from random coefficient model
# First remove NAs from the data
elk.c = elk2[which((elk2$ctotrisk!="NA"&elk2$totalherb!="NA")==TRUE),]

#Plot observed use
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
plot(elk.c$ctotrisk, elk.c$used,xlab="Risk",ylab="Pr(Use)")
elkids = sort(unique(elk.c$elkuid))
ltypes = rep(1:6,each=3)
lwide = rep(seq(1,3,1),each = 6)
colors = rep(c("red","black","seagreen", "violet", "tan", "orange"),3)

# Begin loop
for (i in elkids){
  # To plot predictions you need to create new data for just that elk
  dat = as.data.frame(model.matrix(terms(fr.rc2),elk.c)[elk.c$elkuid==i,])
  dat$totalherb = mean(dat$totalherb) # Use the mean forage for an elk
  dat[,colnames(dat)=="totalherb:ctotrisk"] = dat$totalherb*dat$ctotrisk # Recalculate the interaction term with the mean forage
  dat$pred.prob = plogis(as.matrix(dat)%*%t(as.vector(coef(fr.rc2)$elkuid[which(elkids==i),]))) # Use matrix algebra to get prediction based on coefficients for each individual elk
  ord = order(dat$ctotrisk) # store the order we want to plot in
  # Draw a line for you prediction
  lines(dat$ctotrisk[ord], dat$pred.prob[ord], lty=ltypes[which(elkids==i)],lwd = lwide[which(elkids==i)],col=colors[which(elkids==i)])
}

legend("right", legend = c("Observed", paste("Elk ",elkids)), pch=c(1,rep(-1,length(elkids))),lty = c(-1,ltypes[1:length(elkids)]),lwd = c(-1,lwide[1:length(elkids)]),col = c(1,colors[1:length(elkids)]), bty = "n")

```

## Plotting Conditional Predictions with 95% CI's

We can use a handy function in ggplot to fill by each individual elk like this as an initial exploration, noting that this is equivalent functionally to the two stage models above. 
```{r}
ggplot(elk2, aes(x=ctotrisk, y = used, colour = elkuidF)) + stat_smooth(method="glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"))
```
Although a few things are wrong with this model. First, the model predictions are based on the fixed-effects, and fixed-effects variance (only) not taking into account the random effects variance.  So the 95% CI's are almost certainly overly precise compared to if they had included the random effects variance. 

Prediction is a HUGE challenge in mixed-effects models! And there are HUGE amounts of pages dedicated to it. Here are just a few pages
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/merTools/vignettes/Using_predictInterval.html

## Predicting with predict() function
?predict.merMod
```{r}
## First we do the basic predictions which are the fixed-effects ignoring random effects
elk2$naive.pred <-predict(forrisk, type = "response")
elk2$fr.rc.pred <- predict(fr.rc, type = "response")
hist(elk2$fr.rc.pred)
# note this is the same as specifying the full random effects 
# elk2$fr.rc.pred3 <- predict(fr.rc, re.form = ~(ctotrisk_sc|elkuid), type = "response")
summary(elk2$fr.rc.pred)

## First we do the basic predictions which are the fixed-effects unconditional on the random effects (i.e., Naive logit)
elk2$fr.rc.pred2 <- predict(fr.rc, re.form = NA, type = "response")
summary(elk2$fr.rc.pred2)

## But note now we can make predictions for JUST individual elk ignoring the variation between individuals in predation risk responses
elk2$fr.rc.pred3 <- predict(fr.rc, re.form = ~(1|elkuid) , type = "response")
summary(elk2$fr.rc.pred3)
hist(elk2$fr.rc.pred3)

### Explore relationships between different predictions

plot(elk2$fr.rc.pred2, elk2$fr.rc.pred)
```
This is the plot of the predictions from the unconditional predictions (X) versus the fully-specified random effects of risk|elkid (y)
```{r}
ggpairs(elk2[46:49])
```
This plot compares the predictions from the full mixed-effect model (fr.rc.pred), the unconditional predictions ignoring the RE's (fr.rc.pred2), the predictions from the model only considering the random effect of individual elk (not response to wolves, fr.rc.pred3), and the naive logistic regression results ignoring everything. 

## Comparing Spatial Predictions from Fixed and Mixed-effect models. 
First, lets plot the same kind of predictions starting with the 'Naive' RSF model
```{r}
ggplot(elk2, aes(utmx, utmy, col = naive.pred)) + geom_point(size=5) + coord_equal() +  scale_colour_gradient(low = 'yellow', high = 'red')
```
Now the random effects model with ctotrisk|elkuid
```{r}
ggplot(elk2, aes(utmx, utmy, col = fr.rc.pred)) + geom_point(size=5) + coord_equal() +  scale_colour_gradient(low = 'yellow', high = 'red')
```
Now the predictions unconditioned on any random effects 
```{r}
ggplot(elk2, aes(utmx, utmy, col = fr.rc.pred2)) + geom_point(size=5) + coord_equal() +  scale_colour_gradient(low = 'yellow', high = 'red')
```
And finally, the spaital predictions holding effects of predation risk constant andonly considering vairation between elk (not as sensible in this example)
```{r}
ggplot(elk2, aes(utmx, utmy, col = fr.rc.pred3)) + geom_point(size=5) + coord_equal() +  scale_colour_gradient(low = 'yellow', high = 'red')
```
Class Discussion : How do these differ? What different hypotheses or models of elk resource selection do they represent? how would you 'tell' which one was the best? 


# Objective 7.5 Predicting using the bootMer() command  - To be Continued...
As the documentation for lme4::predict.merMod() notes:
There is no option for computing standard errors of predictions because it is difficult to define an efficient method that incorporates uncertainty in the variance parameters; we recommend lme4::bootMer() for this task.
```{r}
#boot.fr.rc <- bootMer(fr.rc, FUN = function(x) as.numeric(logLik(x), nsim = 100))
#boot.fr.rc$mle
```
These are the MLE estimates of your beta coefficients given the model structure. Or in the cases where the model is too big or complex, you can extract the prediction intervals using predictInterval() from the package merTools:
http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/147836/prediction-interval-for-lmer-mixed-effects-model-in-r

preds <- predictInterval(fr.rc, newdata = newDat, n.sims = 99)

# Lab Assignment 7

In a concise lab report answer the following questions in JUST a methods & results/discussion format, and include your tidied up R code as an appendix. You only need to report enough methods details specifically about the equations and different model structures you are fitting.  Due electronically March 8th. 

1.	Compare the model structures, Beta’s and SE’s for the naïve fixed-effects, the two-stage and the mixed-effect model structure for migratory GPS collared elk used in this lab.

2.	Make sure to write out the equations, with correct notation, for the naïve fixed-logit, two-stage model, and the mixed effect model. 

3.	What is the ‘best’ model from an AIC perspective? Compare and contrast the 3 different models and their inferences, advantages and disadvantages. 

4.	Be sure to define what a random effect and mixed-effect model is.

5.	In your discussion, answer whether you think there is a functional response to predation risk occurring in these elk? Explain how you test for a functional response for 1 variable, and explain your rationale and expected result.

6. Using the loo.R cross validation R code and .html file, and the 'best' model structure for elk, conduct leave one out cross validation on the top model structure by individual elk.
